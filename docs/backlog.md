# Backlog: ideas for later

Ideas from the owner, not decided and not scheduled. Nothing here is in `docs/SPEC.md` yet; when one is picked up, it goes through the normal design conversation and then into the spec with a status tag.

## Playable character types (raised 2026-09-20)
Choose a character type by its moves, in the style of games such as Hollow Knight or Blasphemous, so the trainer matches the game being practiced for. Different types would change the player's moves and feel (for example a faster, lighter fighter versus a slower, heavier one with longer reach).

Notes for the design: the player's numbers already live in one data file (`src/game/params.ts`), so a character type could later be a named set of those values plus any extra moves. The spec says extra moves are added only when a boss needs them to be fair, so this needs its own design pass.

## Environmental complexity (raised 2026-09-20)
Things happening in the background of the arena that can hurt the player, on top of the boss's own attacks: falling objects, moving hazards, and so on. The spec already lists related mechanics as candidates (arena as a mechanic, lingering hazards, shrinking safe area).

Notes for the design: the M2 boss data format should leave room for an arena section (hazards with their own timing) even though M2 does not build it.

## Random variation of enemies (raised 2026-09-20)
Randomly tweak an enemy's properties within set ranges, so a fight does not feel exactly the same every time (for example attack speed or the gap between attacks varies a little on each attempt).

Notes for the design:
- The simulation is deterministic on purpose (same inputs, same result). Randomness would have to come from a seeded random number generator whose seed is recorded with each attempt, so any fight can be replayed exactly and the stats stay meaningful.
- The spec's tunable boss parameters already include "predictability (fixed vs random order)"; ranges per parameter would extend that.
- The M2 boss data format should be able to hold a range where it now holds a single value, even though M2 uses single values.

## Export only new fights / pagination of the store (raised in the M3b review)
Export reads every saved fight at once; fine for hundreds, would matter for thousands.

## Issues noticed by the owner while testing M3b on the phone (raised 2026-09-21)
Written down only; nothing changed yet.
- **"Custom (from Normal)" shows in the Difficulty row when the menu first opens.** The owner expected plain "Normal" at the start. Possible cause, not yet checked: the phone still holds tweaked values saved during earlier testing (choices are remembered on the device), or a stored value is slightly off the preset. To investigate: does a fresh install show "Normal"?
- **The menu screens have no Back button on screen.** Tweak difficulty, Settings, Stats (and the summary) can only be left with the controller's top button, so touch-only use cannot go back. A "Back" row or button on each of those screens would fix it (the Stats screen already has a Back row; check the others).
